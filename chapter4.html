        <h2>Chapter 4: Chemical Reactions and Equations</h2>
        <p>In this chapter, we will explore the different types of chemical reactions and how to represent them using chemical equations. Understanding chemical reactions is fundamental to the study of chemistry.</p>
        
        <h3>Types of Chemical Reactions</h3>
        <p>Chemical reactions can be classified into several types based on the changes that occur. Here are some common types of chemical reactions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Synthesis Reactions:</strong> Two or more simple substances combine to form a more complex product (e.g., \(2H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O\)).</li>
            <li><strong>Decomposition Reactions:</strong> A complex molecule breaks down into simpler substances (e.g., \(2H_2O \rightarrow 2H_2 + O_2\)).</li>
            <li><strong>Single Replacement Reactions:</strong> An element replaces another element in a compound (e.g., \(Zn + 2HCl \rightarrow ZnCl_2 + H_2\)).</li>
            <li><strong>Double Replacement Reactions:</strong> The ions of two compounds exchange places in an aqueous solution to form two new compounds (e.g., \(AgNO_3 + NaCl \rightarrow AgCl + NaNO_3\)).</li>
            <li><strong>Combustion Reactions:</strong> A substance combines with oxygen, releasing energy in the form of light and heat (e.g., \(CH_4 + 2O_2 \rightarrow CO_2 + 2H_2O\)).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Balancing Chemical Equations</h3>
        <p>Balancing chemical equations is essential to ensure the law of conservation of mass is upheld. The number of atoms for each element must be the same on both sides of the equation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify the reactants and products in the reaction.</li>
            <li>Write the unbalanced equation.</li>
            <li>Count the number of atoms of each element on both sides of the equation.</li>
            <li>Add coefficients to balance the number of atoms for each element.</li>
            <li>Check to ensure the equation is balanced.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example: Balancing the combustion of methane</p>
        <pre>Unbalanced: CH<sub>4</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O</pre>
        <pre>Balanced: CH<sub>4</sub> + 2O<sub>2</sub> → CO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O</pre>

        <h3>Stoichiometry</h3>
        <p>Stoichiometry involves the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It allows chemists to predict the amounts of substances consumed and produced in a given reaction.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mole Ratio:</strong> The ratio of moles of one substance to the moles of another substance in a balanced equation.</li>
            <li><strong>Limiting Reactant:</strong> The reactant that is completely consumed in a reaction, limiting the amount of product formed.</li>
            <li><strong>Theoretical Yield:</strong> The maximum amount of product that can be produced from a given amount of reactant.</li>
            <li><strong>Actual Yield:</strong> The amount of product actually obtained from a reaction.</li>
            <li><strong>Percent Yield:</strong> The ratio of actual yield to theoretical yield, expressed as a percentage.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reaction Rates and Equilibrium</h3>
        <p>The rate of a chemical reaction is the speed at which reactants are converted into products. Factors affecting reaction rates include temperature, concentration, surface area, and the presence of catalysts.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Increasing temperature generally increases reaction rates by providing more energy to reactant molecules.</li>
            <li><strong>Concentration:</strong> Higher concentrations of reactants lead to more frequent collisions and faster reaction rates.</li>
            <li><strong>Surface Area:</strong> Greater surface area allows for more collisions and a faster reaction rate.</li>
            <li><strong>Catalysts:</strong> Substances that increase reaction rates without being consumed in the reaction.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Chemical equilibrium occurs when the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal, resulting in constant concentrations of reactants and products.</p>
